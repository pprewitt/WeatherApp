# WeatherApp


The assigment was to create a weather web application, which includes:
   
   *weather data presented on search for a city
   *current day weather (wind, temp, humidity, UV index) and 5 day forecast (temp, humidity, date)
   *color styling for UV index warnings
   *use of local storage to store history of searched cities
   *buttons of searched cities to toggle weather display between cities


## Discussion

I indexed this poorly to start and then just kept trying to support a poor index method with my code. I changed the indexing and made my life easier. added hover effects for the save button and a little bit longer day, as my days are longer while I am taking this class. 


## Deployment

This site is deployed within github pages (https://pprewitt.github.io/WeatherApp/)
