# WeatherApp


The assigment was to create a weather web application, which includes:
   
   *weather data presented on search for a city
   *current day weather (wind, temp, humidity, UV index) and 5 day forecast (temp, humidity, date)
   *color styling for UV index warnings
   *use of local storage to store history of searched cities
   *buttons of searched cities to toggle weather display between cities


## Discussion

I think struggling through the last project helped make this project a lot easier. I am happy with the result. The app will store your search history in buttons on the left. It loads the last city you searched, and will not duplicate buttons if you search a city more than once. The clear list button will clear localStorage as well as the button list.
